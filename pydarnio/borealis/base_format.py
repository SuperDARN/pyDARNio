Design Concept for Borealis Format Classes
------------------------------------------
In using formats as static classes without instantiation, the
Borealis formats have been developed with inheritance in mind. This
allows restructuring of the formats to be set up within the
BaseFormat parent class, as well as some other basic class methods,
while allowing the format to specify its unique characteristics
(fields and their types) in specified classmethods and staticmethods
which should be rewritten by the class.

All borealis format classes inherit from BaseFormat to make use
of the BaseFormat internal methods used for restructuring.

See Also
--------
- borealis_formats module, where the current formats are set up.
- The Borealis documentation on formats is at
  https://borealis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/borealis_data.html

Notes
-----
- 'borealis_git_hash' and 'sqn_timestamps' are necessary fields for all
  versions and formats. 'borealis_git_hash' is necessary as its use is
  hardcoded  into the code in order to determine the format version to use.
  'sqn_timestamps' is necessary as all formats use this field to restructure
  from site to arrayand vice versa.

    The base format of all Borealis format classes.

    Class Methods that Vary with Format
    -----------------------------------
    All Borealis formats should inherit from this class. The following class
    methods should be specific to the format and therefore should be
    overwritten by the format. These methods classify the fields in
    a format and how they are used in restructuring.

    All fields possible = single_element_types + array_dtypes
    All fields are then also classified into four types to determine
    how to restructure: shared_fields (all records have the same value),
    unshared_fields (all records have unique value/array),
    array_specific_fields (used mainly where dimensions
    may vary between records so the number to parse needs to be stored),
    and site_specific_fields (used mainly where dimensions of
    flattened arrays need to be stored).

    unshared_fields require dimensions to be generated when structuring
    from the opposite type (array/site), and array specific and site specific
    formats require generator functions when converting from the opposite
    type.

    The following class methods classify the field types and provide
    generation information when restructuring from the opposite structure.

    is_restructureable(): bool
        A boolean setting whether the format is restructureable.
        If the format is restructureable, the shared_fields and
        unshared_fields_dims_array and unshared_fields_dims_site
        are necessary to restructure using the
        _site_to_array and _array_to_site class methods.
    single_element_types(): dict
        Dictionary of data field name to type for the format. This
        dictionary should contain all fields in a record
        that are not numpy arrays.
    array_dtypes(): dict
        Dictionary of data field names where numpy arrays are expected,
        to numpy dtype for the format. This dictionary should contain all
        fields that would be an array per record.
    shared_fields(): list
        List of the fields that are common (shared) across records. This
        means that they can be reduced to a single value/array per file when
        they are array restructured.
    unshared_fields_dims_array(): dict
        Unshared field: dimensions per record in array structure. Unshared
        fields are not common across records. In array structure the first
        dimension will be num_records followed by these dimensions. Dimensions
        are provided as functions that will calculate the dimension given the
        records or site data dictionary. This class method is used to convert
        from site structure to array structure.
    unshared_fields_dims_site(): dict
        Unshared field: dimensions per record in site structure. Unshared
        fields are not common across records. These dimensions can vary per
        record so the functions take the arrays data dictionary and the
        record number. This class method is used to convert from array
        structure to site structure.
    array_specific_fields_generate(): dict
        Any fields that are array specific or require specific function to
        generate. The key is the name of the array specific field and the
        value in the dictionary is the function that takes the
        records (site data dictionary) to generate the value for that field.
        This class method is used when restructuring from site to array style.
    site_specific_fields_generate(): dict
        Any fields that are site specific or require specific function to
        generate. The key is the name of the site specific field and the
        value in the dictionary is the function that takes the arrays
        (array data dictionary) and the record_num to generate the value for
        that field at that record number. This class method is used when
        restructuring from array to site style.

    Static Methods that Vary with Format
    ------------------------------------
    The following static methods should be specific to the format and
    can be overwritten by the format.

    reshape_site_arrays(records): OrderedDict
        A function to reshape a record field if it has been flattened
        for storage in the site file (a common convention). The
        fields for reshaping and their dimensions are specific to the
        format. This is a necessary function for interpreting site data.
    flatten_site_arrays(records): OrderedDict
        A function to flatten record fields if needed for storing in the
        site structure. The fields for flattening are specific to the
        format.

    Class Methods Common Across Formats
    -----------------------------------
    These following methods use the format-specific methods above to generate
    their values and therefore should not be overwritten by the format class:

    unshared_fields: list
        List of the fields that are not common across records and therefore
        must be stored as an array with first dimension = num_records in the
        array structure.
    array_specific_fields: list
        List of fields that are only present in array files.
    site_specific_fields: list
        List of fields that are only present in site files.
    site_fields: list
        List of all fields that are in the site file type.
    array_fields: list
        List of all fields that are in the array file type.
    site_single_element_fields : list
        List of fields in the site files that are single element types.
    site_single_element_types: dict
        subset of single_element_types with only site keys.
    site_array_dtypes_fields : list
        List of fields in the site files that are made of numpy arrays.
    site_array_dtypes: dict
        subset of array_dtypes with only site keys.
    array_single_element_fields : list
        List of fields in the array files that are single element types.
        Note that if the field is unshared it will appear as an
        array of the type in the arrays data dictionary so no unshared fields
        will appear in this list.
    array_single_element_types: dict
        subset of single_element_types with only array fields.
    array_array_dtypes_fields : list
        List of fields in the array files that are made of numpy arrays.
        Includes fields that are single element but are unshared so are
        converted to arrays in the array file.
    array_array_dtypes: dict
        fields in the array files that are made of numpy arrays, with their
        given data type.
    string_fields: list
        List of all fields that contain string data.
    single_string_fields: list
        List of single element fields which are string types.
    array_string_fields: list
        List of array fields which are string types.
    bool_types: list
        List of single element fields that have boolean data types.
    _site_to_array(data_dict): dict
        Convert an OrderedDict of site data to array data using the information
        provided for the specific data format.
    _array_to_site(data_dict): OrderedDict
        Convert a dictionary of array data to site data using the information
        provided for the specific data format.

    Static Methods Common Across Formats
    ------------------------------------
    find_max_sequences(records): int
        Find the max number of sequences between records in a site file, for
        restructuring to arrays.
    find_max_beams(records): int
        Find the max number of beams between records in a site file, for
        restructuring to arrays.
    find_max_blanked_samples(records): int
        Find the max number of blanked samples between records in a site file,
        for restructuring to arrays.
